# SmartHome Automation System

Welcome to the SmartHome Automation System repository! This project aims to create a comprehensive home automation system, allowing users to control and monitor their smart devices remotely.

## Overview

The SmartHome Automation System is designed to enhance the convenience and efficiency of daily life by providing centralized control over various smart devices. Users can manage their home's lighting, temperature, security, and more through a unified and user-friendly interface.

## Features

- **Device Control:** Remotely control smart lights, thermostats, door locks, and other compatible devices.
- **Automation Rules:** Create automation rules to trigger actions based on specific conditions (e.g., time of day, sensor data, user preferences).
- **Energy Management:** Monitor and optimize energy usage by tracking device consumption and providing insights.
- **Security Integration:** Integrate with smart security cameras and door/window sensors for enhanced home security.
- **Mobile App:** Access the system via a mobile app for on-the-go control and monitoring.
